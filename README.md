CS 103 Fall 2021 UAB Prof Dr. Mahmut Unan

This is the folder of all work I did in CS 103. Labs are weekly assignments and projects are larger scale assignements done over two week increments.
During this class I used Jupiter Notebooks and Jupiter labs, but I have recently started converting some of the assignments to .py files to edit in VIM (which is why some are .jpynb and some are .py)

I will continue to update these as I am able until they are all .py files. Sorry for the inconvenience.
